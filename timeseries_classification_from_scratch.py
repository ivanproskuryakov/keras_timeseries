## Standardize the data

Our timeseries are already in a single length (500). However, their values are
usually in various ranges. This is not ideal for a neural network;
in general we should seek to make the input values normalized.
For this specific dataset, the data is already z-normalized: each timeseries sample
has a mean equal to zero and a standard deviation equal to one. This type of
normalization is very common for timeseries classification problems, see
[Bagnall et al. (2016)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-016-0483-9).

Note that the timeseries data used here are univariate, meaning we only have one channel
per timeseries example.
We will therefore transform the timeseries into a multivariate one with one channel
using a simple reshaping via numpy.
This will allow us to construct a model that is easily applicable to multivariate time
series.

## Build a model

We build a Fully Convolutional Neural Network originally proposed in
[this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06455).
The implementation is based on the TF 2 version provided
[here](https://github.com/hfawaz/dl-4-tsc/).
The following hyperparameters (kernel_size, filters, the usage of BatchNorm) were found
via random search using [KerasTuner](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-tuner).

We can see how the training accuracy reaches almost 0.95 after 100 epochs.

training until it reaches almost 0.97 for both the validation and the training accuracy

accuracy will start decreasing while the training accuracy will continue on increasing:
